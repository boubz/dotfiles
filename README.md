dotfiles
========

My dotfiles repository - use vim, tmux, tmuxinator, nvm, rbenv...

### How to install

Run the following script on an empty Ubuntu Install (script is a work in progress):
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbrisbout/dotfiles/master/initial-setup.sh
sh ./initial-setup.sh
```
